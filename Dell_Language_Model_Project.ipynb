    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to classify Dell Technical Support emails into 'software' or 'hardware' catagories. A total of 1324 emails where taken via Dell in-house case scraping tool. 662 emails labelled as Software ('sw') and 662 labbeled as Hardware related ('hw') based on the researcher's domain knowledge. The dataset was saved as a CSV file, with each row being one email.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook begins with usinga  pretrained language model (Wikitext103) which understands teh stucture of language, and use it to read and predict emails as being 'sw' or 'hw'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emails themselves are tokenized (seperate sentences into words) and using special 'tokens' we can ensure that each example per-batch is of the same size (padding samll emails with nonsense reserved tokens, 'xxunk') and the words are numericalised to form a vocabulary (starting with the most common occuring word). \n",
    "\n",
    "To improve perforance we then train are own language model(based on LSTM architecture) on Dell sepcific vocaburary. The model is tasked with predicting the next occuring word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we train our new language model to again classify the images, and gradually unfreeze each layer to improve performance further."
